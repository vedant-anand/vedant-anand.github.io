                <h2>Euclid</h2>
                <p>
                    Euclid, sometimes called Euclid of Alexandria to distinguish him from Euclid of Megara, was a Greek mathematician, often referred to as the "founder of geometry" or the "father of geometry". He was active in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I.
	He lived lots of his life in Alexandria, Egypt, and developed many mathematical theories. He is most famous for his works in geometry, inventing many of the ways we conceive of space, time, and shapes.

                <h2>Guido Fubini</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied under the notable mathematicians Ulisse
                    Dini and Luigi Bianchi. He gained some early fame when his 1900 doctoral thesis, entitled Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces, was discussed in a widely read work on differential geometry published by Bianchi in 1902.

                <h2> Leonardo Bonacci</h2>
                <p>
                   Fibonacci, also known as Leonardo Bonacci, Leonardo of Pisa, or Leonardo Bigollo Pisano, was an Italian mathematician from the Republic of Pisa, considered to be "the most talented Western mathematician of the Middle Ages"
                    Fibonacci is remembered for two important contributions to Western mathematics: He helped spread the use of Hindu systems of writing numbers in Europe (0,1,2,3,4,5 in place of Roman numerals).
